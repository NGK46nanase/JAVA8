1. Start out with a conceptual understanding of the whole in order to understand what needs to be accomplished
2. Identify the patterns that are present in the whole
3. Start with those patterns that create the context for the others.
4. Apply these patterns
5. Repeat with the remaining patterns, as well as with any new patterns that were discovered along the way
6. Finally, refine the design and implement within the context created by applying these patterns one at a time
