#Interface
* To upcast to more than one base type ( and the flexibility that this provides).
* To prevent the client programmer from making an object of this class and to establish that it is only an interface.

Normally, you can use _extends_ with only a single class, but _extends_ can refer to multiple base interfaces when building a new 
interface.
