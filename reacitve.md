 * __Message-drive__ Based on asychronous communication in which the designs of sender and recipient aren't affected by the means of 
 message propagation, which means that you can design your system in isolation without worrying about how the message are transmitted. 
 Message-driven communication leads to a loosely coupled design that provides scalability, resilience, and responsiveness.
 
 * __Elasic__ Reacting to load. The system stays responsive under varying workloads. Reactive applications can actively scale up or scale 
 down based on use or other metrics employed by system designers, saving money on unused computing power, but (most importantly) ensuring
  the service of a growing or spiking user base.
  
 * __Resilient__ Reacting to failure. The system stays responsive in the face of failure. Failure is expected and embraced, and because
 many system exist in isolation, a single point of failure remains just that. The system responds appropriately wit strategies for 
 restarting or reprovisioning, seamless to the overall systems.
 
 * __Responsive__ Reacting to users. The system responds in a timely manner if at all possible. Responsiveness is the cornnerstone of
 usability and utilityl more than that, it also means that problems may be detected quickly and dealt with effectively.
