## 1
Describe an efficient algorithm for converting a fully balanced string of parentheses into an equivalent tree. The tree associated with such a string is
defined recursively. The outermost pair of balanced parentheses is associated with the root and each substring inside tis pair, defined by the substring
betwwen two balanced parentheses, is associtated with a subtree of this root.

## 2
The **path length** of a tree T is the sum of the depths of all positions in T. Describe a linear-time method for computing the path length of a Tree T.

## 3
Define the **internal path length**, I(T), of a tree T to be the sum of the depths of all the internal positions in T. Likewise, define the external path
length, E(T), of a tree T to be the sum of the depths of all the external positions in T. Show that if T is a proper binary tree with n positions, then 
E(T) = I(T) + n -1.
