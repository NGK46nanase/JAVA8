# JAVA8

## Template method
- Implement an algorithm in a method, deferring the definition of some steps of the algorithm so that subclasses can be redefine them.

## State
- Distribute an operation so that each class represents a different state

## STRATEGY
- Encapsulate an operation, making implementations interchangeable

## COMMAND
- Encapsulate a method call in an object

## INTERPRETER
- Distribute an operation so that each implementation applies to a different type of composition
